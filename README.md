JavaFX Tetris Clone Game
=============

## Todo



Everyone will code together.

1. Before you start working on a task, commit your name to it in `main` by adding parentheses to the right  e.g. (Clay).  
2. If you run into difficulties, take your name off the task and move on to something else.  
3. As you complete each task, do the following in **your own** branch: ~~cross them  off the list~~ using Strikethrough, add the changes to the code in your own branch, then open a new Pull Request back to `main`.
4. Make sure you open Pull Request to `claycurry34/main`, rather than the `main` of the original repository.

Once we are done implementing changes, two members will conduct testing as the other two members write the report (research article style). If you realize something needs to be added to this list, just add it directly to the list in `main`.

* ~~Change the background picture to something more visually pleasing. (Eliseo)~~
* ~~Change the coloring of the blocks to their standard game colors. (Eliseo)~~
* Implement a method (maybe a class) that constructs a Next Piece column inside a Pane object(Most likely a VBox). The column should have a capacity of 4 pieces. Slots should be individually addressable for getting and setting. You will likely need to make an image outside of Java and display it using an Image and Imageview. **(Clay)**
  * Add getters and setters.
* Implement a method (maybe a class) that constructs a Store Piece box inside a Pane object.
  * Add getters and setters.  
  * Implement user controls for using the Store Box.  
* Implement Clockwise rotation.
* Implement Hard Drop.

* Create default controls then implement a method for reassigning controls, one-by-one.



The final report should be about 1500 words long (1200 minimum, 2100 maximum). complete the following outline:

### Introduction
* State the general problem/need and approach to solving/satisfying it.  
* Briefly describe your intended product and how it is meant to be used.  
* Briefly describe your results and high-level conclusions.  

### Example 
* Tell a story about how your product works through an example, with a detailed screenshot. Guide the reader by referring to the screenshot throughout the story.

### Process 
* Provide an overview of your general approach.  
* Summarize the steps in your process.  
* Briefly describe and assess your planned versus actual timeline of tasks.  
* Describe and analyze any major changes made over the course of the project.  

### Detailed Results 
* Provide an overview of the normal and special features of your final product.  
* Describe in detail the design of your product (appearance and behavior).  
* Describe your implementation including how you structured your code, which libraries/capabilities you used, and any development tools you used.  
* Describe usage requirements (device, environment, user capabilities, etc.)

### Future Decisions
* Describe major features that you planned but left undesigned or unimplemented.  
* Describe at least one major unplanned feature that you would add next.  
* Discuss potential directions for expanded development in the future.

### Conclusion
* Briefly recap the problem, goal, and contributions/results of your project.

### Team Summary
* List your team members and describe their role(s) in the project.
